This repository contains solutions to laboratory problems for the Artificial Intelligence course

Laboratory Tasks:
1. Regression
   a) Closed-Form solution
   b) Gradient
2. 0/1 Knapsack problem - Genetic Algorithm
3. Connect4 - Minimax and Alphabeta pruning
4. Titanic: Decision Tree and Random Forest binary classification
5. Kmeans clustering
6. Neural Nets
7. Reinforcement Learning


Most of the code was provided to me by the instructor for the laboratory. My task was to implement artificial intelligence algorithms marked in the #TODO sections
